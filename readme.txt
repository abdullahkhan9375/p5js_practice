hello!
This exercise uses p5 combined with Javascript.

I have setup a scene in index.html. I will need you to follow the following instructions.

Set up your environment:
1. install the live server extension on VSCode to be able to open the html file. Use help from chatgpt if you
have to.
2. Open up documentation for the p5 framework.


Working on the code:
1. I have listed out the tasks that you need to with the comment "Task #number: ". Search for the comments in main.js

Tasks overview:
1. Implement the ground class.
2. Refactor the car class over to a new file and import.
3. Design and implement a Fuel class.


if you are done with all the tasks, create new files for each class. For example, car class should be in car.js.
sun class should be in sun.js.
