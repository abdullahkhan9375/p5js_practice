hello!
This exercise uses p5 combined with Javascript.

I have setup a scene in index.html. I will need you to follow the following instructions.

Set up your environment:
0. clone this locally. use the command below...
git clone git@github.com:abdullahkhan9375/p5js_practice.git

1. install the live server extension on VSCode to be able to open the html file. Use help from chatgpt if you
have to.

2. Open up documentation for the p5 framework for help.

3. Use the live server extension to open up the html file.

you can use chatgpt to help you with only the above tasks ^


Working on the code:
1. I have listed out the tasks that you need to with the comment "Task #number: ". Search for the comments in main.js

if you are done with all the tasks, create new files for each class. For example, car class should be in car.js.
sun class should be in sun.js.
